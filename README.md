## ðŸ”¹ About This Project
This project demonstrates my ability to:  
- Work with raw sales data.  
- Build pivot tables and charts in Excel.  
- Design clear dashboards for business insights.  
- Communicate findings in a professional portfolio format.

- "Despite assumptions, weather and fuel price showed no significant impact on Walmart weekly sales. Store-level performance analysis highlighted that Store 20, 4, and 14 consistently outperform peers. Future dashboards will include forecast models for seasonal trends."
